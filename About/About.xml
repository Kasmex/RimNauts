This mod adds Near Earth Objects (NEO) like moons, asteroids and space debris. Everything is visable and animated in an orbit on the world map. The moon is a playable biome which you need to discover and travel to using a rocket.


Known issues
- There's a bug that causes the moon to disappear when the camera moves(not zooming) far enough away from it.

- THIS MOD REQUIRES A NEW SAVE TO SEE THE MOON
