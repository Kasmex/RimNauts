This mod adds Near Earth Objects like moons, asteroids and space debris. Everything is visable and animated as an orbit on the world map mode. The moon is a playable biome which you need to discover and travel to using a rocket.


Known issues
- There's a bug that causes the moon to disappear when the camera moves far enough away from it (not zooming, I mean when you pan across the world).

- THIS MOD REQUIRES A NEW SAVE TO SEE THE MOON
